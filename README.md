# Nova Injector

This is a simple nova injector i made. This allows you to bypass the new project nova anti cheat (presadio). This injector will prob get dtc in a day but if you replace the drivers you can make it ud.

## Kernel Information

This injector is not just for nova. This will work for all games. All you have to do is change the window name to inject to. By default it’s set to “UnrealWindow” as that is the class name for fortnite. You can find your games class name by just looking it up on google prob. The dll name and class name can be found in the code in main.cpp that looks like this (it’s at the bottom):
```cpp
payson1337(“UnrealWindow”, “subz.dll”);
```

Just replace this with your desired class name and dll name. You can also replace the drivers in this. This is a fully working open source kernel injector. You can change the drivers to be used for whatever game u want.

## Usage

### Build

To use the build, simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/paysonism/Nova-Injector/releases) tab and make sure you download the latest version. Now just replace the dll in there with your dll. Make sure your dll is named “subz.dll” otherwise it won’t work.

### Source

To use the source code, just build as release and then follow the same steps as above for dll formatting.

## Credits
